# Package Support Framework
This project provides tools, libraries, documentation and samples for creating app-compat fixups to enable classic Win32 applications to be distributed and executed as MSIX packaged apps.

Here are some common examples where you can find the PSF useful:
	1. Your app can't find some .dlls when launched, you may need to set your current working directory.
	You can learn about the required current working directory in the original shortcut before you converted to MSIX.
	2. The app writes into the install folder. You will typically see it by "ACCESS DENIED" errors in 
	[Process Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) 
	As appears in the following image;
	![ProcMon Logfile](procmon_logfile.png)
	3. Your app needs to pass parameters to the executable on launch.
	You can learn more about how to identify compatability issues [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/psf/package-support-framework#identify-packaged-application-compatibility-issues)
	And about the available configurations [here] or in the Documention [section below](https://github.com/microsoft/MSIX-PackageSupportFramework/tree/master/PsfLauncher)

We are looking for your feedback, please file any issues or feedback in the [Issues section](https://github.com/Microsoft/MSIX-PackageSupportFramework/issues) or in our [tech community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Package-Support-Framework/bd-p/Package-Support)

## Documentation
Check out our [step by step guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/porting/package-support-framework), it will walk you through the main PSF workflows and provides the key documentation. Check out the [PSF scripts support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/psf/run-scripts-with-package-support-framework) that we recently added to our framework, it provides great flexibility to your packages.

## Get the pre-built PSF Binaries
Download the PSF binaries from [Nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.PackageSupportFramework)
Treat it just as a .zip file, rename the suffix to .zip and unzip it, you will find the required binaries in the /bin folder. (we are planning to make it easier going forward and locate the binaries directly on GitHub, hold tightðŸ˜Š)

## Branch structure
Package Support Framework adopts a development and master branching style.

### Master

## Fixup Metadata
Each fixup and the PSF Launcher has a metadata file in xml format.  Each file contains the following  
 1. Version:  The version of the PSF is in MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format according to [Sem Version 2](https://semver.org/)
 2. Minimum Windows Platform the the minimum windows version required for the fixup or PSF Launcher.
 3. Description: Short description of the fixup.
 4. WhenToUse: Heuristics on when you should apply the fixup.

Additionally, we have the XSD for the metadata files.  THe XSD is located in the solution folder.

## Data/Telemetry
Telemetry datapoint has been hooked to collect usage data and sends it to Microsoft to help improve our products and services. Read Microsoft's [privacy statement to learn more](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement). However, data will be collected only when the PSF binaries are used from [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=packagesupportframework) 
on Windows 10 devices and only if users have enabled collection of data. The Nuget package has binaries signed and will collect usage data from machine. When the binaries are built locally by cloning the repo or downloading the bits, then telemetry is not collected.
