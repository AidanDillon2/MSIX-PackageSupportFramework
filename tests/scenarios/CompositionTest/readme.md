# Composition Test
A very simple composition test with two dlls that shim the same function. The first dll loaded shims the `MessageBox` API to append the string `"And you've been shimmed again!"` to the end of the text passed to the `MessageBox` function. The second dll loaded unconditionally replaces the text with the string `"SUCCESS: You've been shimmed!"`. When execution is successful, the test's application code will call the `MessageBox` API with the string `"FAILED: This message should have been shimmed"`, which will get replaced by the second shim described above, which will then call into the first dll described above to append its text. If all this works correctly, the end result should be that the message box's text should read `"SUCCESS: You've been shimmed! And you've been shimmed again!"`.
