# File System Test
A collection of smaller tests that primarily test the functionality of the [File Redirection Fixup](../../../FileRedirectionFixup/readme.md). Each test is intended to exercise as few filesystem API fixups as possible (ideally one at a time), however this is not always achievable. E.g. most every test will exercise the `CreateFile` fixup in order to either (1) create a file in a redirected location, or (2) read the contents of a redirected file that should have been created/modified by the API being tested.
